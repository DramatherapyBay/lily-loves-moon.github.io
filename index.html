    <h1>About Dramatherapy</h1>
    <p>This version is designed with a clean, professional layout that uses plenty of white space and clear headings. The tone is warm and reassuring, aiming to remove any "performance anxiety" a potential client might feel.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>About Dramatherapy</h2>
  <p>Dramatherapy is a gentle, creative path to emotional well-being. It is a form of psychological therapy that uses our natural capacity for imagination and play to help us understand ourselves better.</p>
  <p>Sometimes, life's challenges are hard to put into words. Dramatherapy provides a "creative language" to help you express feelings, process experiences, and find new ways forward in a safe, supportive environment.</p>

  <h2>A Creative Partnership</h2>
  <p>The most important thing to know is that you do not need to be an actor or an artist. There is no "audience" and no "performance."</p>
  <p>Dramatherapy is not about being "good" at drama; it is about using simple creative tools to explore your inner world. You are never forced to use a specific art form. Instead, different options are offered to you as invitations—you choose what feels right for you on any given day.</p>

  <h2>Your Creative Toolkit</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Storytelling & Metaphor:</strong> Using myths or making up stories to explore life themes.</li>
    <li><strong>Objects & Sand Play:</strong> Placing small figures in sand or using objects to represent feelings.</li>
    <li><strong>Creative Writing & Drawing:</strong> Using journals, poetry, or simple images to express a thought.</li>
    <li><strong>Images & Cards:</strong> Using visual prompts to spark a conversation or a feeling.</li>
    <li><strong>Music & Sound:</strong> Using rhythm or melody to connect with your emotions.</li>
    <li><strong>Body Movement:</strong> Gentle ways to notice how your body holds stress or strength.</li>
    <li><strong>Role Play & Enactment:</strong> Exploring a situation from a new perspective in a safe way.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What Happens in a Session?</h2>
  <p>While every session is tailored to your specific needs, we generally follow a structured rhythm to ensure you feel grounded and safe:</p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Phase</th>
      <th>What We Do</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Check-in</td>
      <td>A quiet moment to land in the space and share how you are feeling.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Warm-up</td>
      <td>A light activity to help you transition from your busy day into a creative mindset.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Main Activity</td>
      <td>Using a creative tool (like a story or sand tray) to explore a specific theme.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Reflection</td>
      <td>A time to talk about what happened and what it might mean for you.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>De-roling</td>
      <td>A simple step to "leave the work behind" so you can return to your daily life.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Check-out</td>
      <td>A final grounding moment to ensure you feel ready to leave the session.</td>
