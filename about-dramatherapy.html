  <h1>What is Dramatherapy</h1>

  <h2>A Holistic Approach to Healing</h2>
  <p>Unlike traditional talk therapy, dramatherapy engages the whole person – mind, body, and spirit – creating opportunities for profound healing and self-discovery. Through the safe medium of creative play and storytelling, individuals can explore difficult emotions and develop greater self-awareness.</p>

  <p>This innovative therapeutic approach allows clients to safely explore their emotions, experiences, and relationships through techniques such as role-play, improvisation, storytelling, and creative movement.</p>

  <h3>Evidence-Based Practice</h3>
  <p>Dramatherapy is recognized by the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) and is used in hospitals, schools, community centers, and private practice settings worldwide.</p>
